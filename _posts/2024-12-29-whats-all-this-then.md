## Whats All This Then?

Well, whats all this then? This is me trying to keep myself accountable and documenting my progress as a developer. Who am I? Check the [About](https://alexthemeh.github.io/about/) page for a proper break down but the long and short of it is my names Alex and I want to be a software developer.
How am I going to get this glittering career? The pretty desks? The fast chairs? Worry not I have a plan. Or at least concepts of a plan.

## The Plan

The plan is simple,

1. Learn a bunch of programming languages, eg; python, react, javascript, ect
2. Gain a bunch of certificates to prove I can program
3. Apply to as many jobs as I can
4. ???
5. New job! :D
6. Profit.

Now, dont be dismayed by my devil-may-care attitude in this post, Im under no illuision that this a good plan or that it will be that easy but its a start and I always find the start is the hardest part.
For now Im just going to keep on keeping on learning new languages in what little spare time I have, work on impressive projects and keep you all up to date on this here blog. I'll try and write at least a post each Sunday but we'll see how that goes.

Its 11pm now and I have to work tomorrow so Ill leave you for now friends, take care.
