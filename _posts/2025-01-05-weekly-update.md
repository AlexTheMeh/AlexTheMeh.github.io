## Another Week Down

Welcome back reader, *or if its your first time*, welcome to my blog. Hope you've had a pleasent week, I had to perform first aid on a colleagues foot, its alright I think he'll keep it. Apart from that I used my limited spare time to start on the "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" by Dr.Angela Yu on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/?couponCode=NEWYEARCAREER). Only done 2 days of it and so far its pretty basic stuff but it's proving a worth while purchase and Im looking forward to the rest of the course. Of course I will keep you updated here loyal reader.
If you cast your eyes towards the bottom of this page, you should see a comment box. If not somethings buggered up but if you can see a comment section then three cheers for me. Adding commenting took me a little longer than Id like to admit but admit I shall in a tutorial post that'll be up at somepoint.
Truth be told dear reader thats about it for this week, not got much else to update you on but I'll be back next week hopefully with more to tell you about.
